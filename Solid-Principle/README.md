SOLID Principles Recap
1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
   ðŸ”‘ Key Idea: One class = One responsibility.

Example:

ReportGenerator â†’ Formats reports.
FileExporter â†’ Exports files.
ðŸ›‘ Bad: Mixing both responsibilities in one class.
âœ… Good: Split them into two classes.

ðŸ“Œ Pop-Up:

"If I need to change how files are exported, I only touch FileExporter, not ReportGenerator."
2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
   ðŸ”‘ Key Idea: Extend without modifying.

Example:

Discount â†’ Interface.
BlackFridayDiscount â†’ 30% off.
ClearanceSaleDiscount â†’ 50% off.
CombinedDiscount â†’ Combines discounts.
ðŸ›‘ Bad: Adding if-else in the base class for every discount type.
âœ… Good: Add new classes for each discount.

ðŸ“Œ Pop-Up:

"To add a new discount, I just create a new class implementing Discountâ€”no need to touch old code!"
3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
   ðŸ”‘ Key Idea: Subclasses must behave like their parent class.

Example:

Bird â†’ Parent class.
Sparrow â†’ Flies.
Penguin â†’ Doesnâ€™t fly.
ðŸ›‘ Bad: Bird has a fly() method that Penguin canâ€™t use.
âœ… Good: Abstract Bird to focus on shared behavior (e.g., walk()).

ðŸ“Œ Pop-Up:

"Substitute a Penguin for a Bird, and the app shouldnâ€™t break!"
4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
   ðŸ”‘ Key Idea: Smaller, specific interfaces > One huge interface.

Example:

Big Interface: Machine (methods: print(), scan(), fax()).
Split Interfaces:
Printer â†’ print().
Scanner â†’ scan().
Fax â†’ fax().
ðŸ›‘ Bad: Printer class forced to implement scan() and fax() methods it doesnâ€™t use.
âœ… Good: Printer only implements Printer interface.

ðŸ“Œ Pop-Up:

"Let classes implement only what they needâ€”no more, no less!"
5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
   ðŸ”‘ Key Idea: Depend on abstractions, not concrete classes.

Example:

EmailService depends on EmailSender (interface).
SmtpEmailSender and SendGridEmailSender implement EmailSender.
Use Dependency Injection (DI) to pass the desired implementation to EmailService.
ðŸ›‘ Bad: Directly using SmtpEmailSender inside EmailService.
âœ… Good: Use EmailSender interface.

ðŸ“Œ Pop-Up:

"If I switch from SMTP to SendGrid, I donâ€™t touch EmailServiceâ€”just inject the new sender!"
