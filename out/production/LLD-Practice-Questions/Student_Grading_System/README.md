## Scenario: Student Grading System

- Allow students to enroll in courses.
- Calculate final grades based on assignments and exams for each student.
- Generate a grade report (like A, B, C, etc.) for a student.
- Support additional grading strategies in the future (e.g., Pass/Fail, GPA-based grading).
